    title: 'Wearable Gas Leak Alert Device',
    description: "Developed a product for the auditorily impaired to alert them of gas leaks using a wearable personal device. Python was used to process data from a gas sensor interfaced with a microcomputer, with alerts outputted to an LCD screen. Autodesk Inventor was used to model the device and the housing component of the microcomputer.",

    title: 'Remote Surgical Tool Sterilization Robot',
    description: "I was part of a team that used Python to program a robot to pick up and sterilize containers housing surgical instruments based on data from electromyography sensors. The containers were also precisely designed using Autodesk Inventor. This project was intended to be utilized by underfunded hospitals in order to outsource the duty of sterilizing surgical equipment to a remote well-funded hospital.",
